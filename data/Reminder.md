# WARNING #
I feel like these warnings should go without saying, but just as a reminder:

1. Do NOT upload ANY patient data to ANY online source other than a dedicated, secured, internal datapoint that your institution provides (ex. Microsoft SharePoint).
2. Always de-identify all patient data in accordance with HIPAA guidelines before using it for these projects. Obtain IRB or ethics board approval.
